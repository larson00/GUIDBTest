GUI Database

Vanselow

GUI Database project. This program takes data from an SQL file that is stored in a database and displays it. The file has rankings for NFL teams, obtained from https://www.ign.com/wikis/madden-nfl-19/Team_Ratings. As of now, it only displays the first team in the table. The GUI is all labels, some of which are just text displays for "Team" or "Division" and the rest that accept the label and display the appropriate data. 

Future functionality includes a loop to scroll the teams, a way to display more than 1 at a time, a way to update rankings based on weekly performance, a dropdown menu to pick a team, and aesthetic changes.
